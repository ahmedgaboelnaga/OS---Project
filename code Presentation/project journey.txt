6- if nothing is found it displays "File not found" and executes the script again toe search for another file
7- if it found files it displays the matching files and type of the found (file or directory)
8- if only one is left it calls the manipulation function

10- then we go to the end of the file to execute the script again to search for new files
11- if more than one is left it calls the display filter options again to apply more serac filters
12- disply_filter_options is called
13- the display filter options calls options again to store the unvisited filters into selected
14- and then the serach function to narrow the search result until there is only one left to apply manipulations
