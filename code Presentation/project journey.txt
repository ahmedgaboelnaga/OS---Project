1- reading the input and building the find command by name to serach
2- then we call the serach function
3- the search function evaluates the find command
4- if nothing is found it displays "File not found" and executes the script again toe search for another file
5- if it found files it displays the found files and type of the found (file or directory)
6- if only one is left it calls the manipulation function
7- the manipulation function is called to apply file manipulation
8- then we go to the end of the file to execute the script again to search for new files
9- if more than one is left it calls the display filter options again to apply more serac filters
10- disply_filter_options is called
11- the display filter options calls options again to store the unvisited filters into selected
12- and then the serach function to narrow the search result until there is only one left to apply manipulations
13- we call manipulations to apply manipulations
14- then we go to the end to ./os.sh to execute the script again to search for a new file
