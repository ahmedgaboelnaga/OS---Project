first we take the name from user
then we build the find_command
and evaluate it if it is empty it echos not found twice
if not it calls the function to display filter options and store the current selection
the function display_filter_options ensures the selections is withing the list
then the program checks if the arguments are not repeated
then we build the find command and evaluate it and display the options


we want first take the name from user
then we build the initial find command to search with name
then we make a function evaluate that takes the find_command and evaluates it
then we search and display the found files if found and if not it runs the script again to search for a new file
if files were found it calls the display_filter_options and takes the selected filteres
the display_filter_options calls the options function to build the find_command
then the search function recursively calls itself again to evaluate the new find command after applying the filters
if there is more than one file you can apply search filters again to narrow the search results but if there is only one you can call 
the function file manipulation to manipulate the files
