# File Search Utility Script README

## Description
This script is a file search utility that allows users to search for files based on various criteria such as file name, size, modification date, file type, and file or directory type. It provides flexible search options and allows manipulation of found files.

## How to Use
1. **Specify Interpreter:** Make sure the script is executed using Bash (`#!/bin/bash`).
2. **Run the Script:** Execute the script `os.sh` in your terminal.
3. **Input File Name:** Enter the name of the file you want to search for.
4. **Filter Options:** Choose filtering options like size, modification date, file type, and file or directory type.
5. **View Matching Files:** The script displays matching files along with their types (file or directory).
6. **File Manipulation:** If only one file is found, you can choose to open, delete, or rename it.
7. **Refine Search:** If multiple files are found, you can apply additional filters to narrow down the search results.
8. **Repeat Search:** The script allows continuous searching for new files by executing itself at the end.

## Functionality Overview
